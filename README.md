# Sentiment-Analysis-
This project focuses on building a Sentiment Analysis system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system analyzes textual data and classifies it into Positive, Negative, or Neutral sentiments.

The main objective of this project is to understand how machines interpret human language and automatically determine the emotional tone behind text data such as reviews, feedback, or comments.
